​#🛡️ Fake News Detection System:
<br>
###​📖 Project Overview:
<br>
​This repository features an end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to classify news articles as Real (1) or Fake (0). By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression, the system provides a robust mechanism for identifying misinformation in real-time.
<br>
​###🛠️ Tech Stack & Development Environment:
<br>
​-Core Language: Python 3.12. 
<br>
​-Data Science: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib. 
<br>
​-Web Interface: Streamlit. 
<br>
​-Infrastructure: WSL (Ubuntu), Docker.
<br>​
###📂 Repository Structure:
<br>​
-experiment.ipynb: Interactive notebook for data exploration, visualization, and model selection. 
<br>
​-train.py: Clean, automated script for model training and generating .pkl artifacts. 
<br>
​-app.py: Streamlit application providing the front-end user experience. 
<br>
​-Dockerfile: Configuration for building a portable, production-ready container. 
<br>
​-.gitignore: Filter to maintain a clean repository by excluding venv/ and raw datasets.
<br>
###📊 Model Information:
<br>
​-Algorithm: Logistic Regression. 
<br>
​-Vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). 
<br>
​-Accuracy: ~98% (Tested on Kaggle dataset).
